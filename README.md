# MyCartBlog

MyCartBlog is an e-commerce website that I developed using Django, a powerful web framework in Python. The platform allows users to browse and purchase a wide range of products, from electronics and fashion to accessories and sports products, all from the comfort of their own home. As a cherry on top, I've added a blog section on website, where you can read the blogs written by me and can interact with me by commenting on the respective blog posts, by creating your user account.
